        <h3>Thomas said he left before the rain worsened, but Evelyn heard a car engine after midnight, and tire tracks
            were found near the garden gate.
            When asked about his departure time, Henry hesitated and avoided eye contact. Did he leave when he said â€” or
            was he still nearby, watching?
            There was something unsettling about the way he dismissed the question, as though he was hiding something.
        </h3>
