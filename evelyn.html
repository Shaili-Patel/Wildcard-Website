        <h3>Evelyn said she was alone in the drawing room with a glass of wine, then retired early with a migraine.
            But Tomas mentioned a wine glass missing from the tray, and the library window was cracked open, though
            Evelyn claimed she had closed it.
            The wind could’ve caused it — or maybe she didn’t want anyone to hear the argument outside. It was strange
            that she couldn’t recall
            exactly when she’d locked the door to her room.
        </h3>
